My journey is a blend of music, technology, advocacy, and a deep-seated commitment to social justice. Each step on this path has contributed to who I am: someone who thrives at the intersection of creativity and innovation,  always driven by the goal of making a difference.  

Growing up in an environment that valued both creativity and analytical thinking, my early fascination with music and technology laid the foundation for my future endeavors. This dual interest led me from studying jazz in Miami to exploring the potentials of audio engineering and beyond, showing me early on how diverse fields can inform and enrich each other.  

My life has been shaped by the various places I've called home, from Terre Haute to international shores in Mauritius and Dominica and the bustling life in Miami. These experiences have broadened my worldview,  reinforcing my commitment to diversity and the importance of building inclusive communities.  

The evolution of my career reflects a journey of constant learning and adapting. Whether through formal education or hands-on experiences, I've sought to merge my skills in meaningful ways. The pivot from music to engaging more deeply with technology wasn't just a career shift but a step towards finding new avenues to empower and assist others.  

At its heart, my story is about seeking out opportunities to learn, grow, and make a tangible impact. My varied experiences have taught me the value of empathy, the importance of listening, and the power of applying one's knowledge and skills to support and uplift those around us.  

Looking ahead, I'm excited by the prospects of further integrating technology with efforts to advance social justice. Inspired by my past but not bound by it, I'm committed to learning, growing, and contributing to a society where technology and knowledge are tools for empowerment and positive change.
