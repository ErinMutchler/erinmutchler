  <ContentSection title="Policy Analysis and Advocacy">
    <p>I have worked on a variety of projects from designing studies to address housing inequality to policy memos to program
      development and more! Check out some of the projects I have worked on below for examples of my work.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Permanent Supportive Housing as a Housing Intervention in Terre Haute, Indiana</h2>
      <p>This study proposal is aimed at addressing housing insecurity in Terre Haute, Indiana. It examines Permanent
        Supportive Housing as a policy alternative
        to traditional housing solutions which require sobriety or treatment compliance as a prerequisite for housing.
        The study proposal is currently awaiting review from various stakeholders and policymakers in Terre Haute before
        proceeding further.</p>

      <h2>Choice Housing Voucher Policy Alternative Memo</h2>
      <p>Choice Housing Vouchers are an important part of fighting housing inequity. However, they often are unsuccessful
        in their goal. This policy memo examines the shortcomings of Choice Housing Vouchers and proposes several policy alternatives
        which could be adopted at various levels of government.</p>
      <p>Download the full policy memo <a href="/Choice Housing Voucher Policy Alternative Memo.pdf" class="in-text-link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Intersectional Identities and Mental Health</h2>
      <p>This policy memo examines the complex relationship between LGBTQIA+ status, intersectional identities, such as age, race, and disability status, and mental health outcomes. Specifically, it analyzes mental health status and access to healthcare services across these intersectional identities within the LGBTQIA+ community. The objective is to enhance our understanding of the numerous factors which contribute to these disparities. By shedding light on these intersectional experiences, this analysis aims to equip policymakers with the necessary insights to address this national concern and to identify potential areas for intervention.</p>
